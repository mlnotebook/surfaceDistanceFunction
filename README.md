# Surface Distance Function
A surface distance function in Python used for evaluating image segmentations

After being unsuccessful at finding a pre-written function online, I created my own function for calculating the surface distance between two segmentations in Python.

For two image-segmentations, this function will return the surface distances (difference in mm between each corresponding pixel in the two segmentations).

It is also possible from this to calculate:

* Mean surface distance (MSD)
* Residual Mean-Square surface distance (RMS)
* Hausdorff Distance (HS)
